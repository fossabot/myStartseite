All svg files follow this guidline:

1. Resize Page to brand/selection
2. Transform size to 250px width
3. Scale Page with the factor 1.2
4. Align brand/selection to center
5. Compress svg file

The background-image color is 75, 50 or 25% lighten of the brand color:
``
$c: #XXXXXX;

c {
  color-75: lighten($c,75%); /* mostly white */
  color-50: lighten($c,50%); /* sometimes white */
  color-25: lighten($c,25%); /* never white */
}
``

Afterwards add 88 as opacity.
